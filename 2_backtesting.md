## 1 | Finding past anomalities

- In the previous section, we identified an anomaly. 
- We found an increase in the 400 status code because the z-score was 6 
- But how do we set the threshold for the z-score? 
    - Is a z-score of 3 an anomaly? What about 2, or 1?
- To **find thresholds** that fit our needs,
    -  We can run simulations on past data with different values and evaluate the results.
    -  **This is often called backtesting**
- The first thing we need to do:
    - calculate the <code>mean</code> and the <code>standard deviation</code> for each status code up until every row, 
    - just as if it is the current value
- This is a classic job for a window function <code>WINDOW</code>:

```sql
WITH calculations_over_window AS (
   SELECT
      status_code,
      period,
      entries,
      AVG(entries) OVER status_window as mean_entries,
      STDDEV(entries) OVER status_window as stddev_entries
   FROM
      server_log_summary
   WINDOW status_window AS (
      PARTITION BY status_code
      ORDER BY period
      ROWS BETWEEN 60 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   )
)
SELECT *
FROM calculations_over_window
ORDER BY period DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

```

- We use a window function, to calculate the **mean** and **standard deviation** over a **sliding window of 60 minutes**.
- To avoid repeating the <code>WINDOW</code> clause for every aggregate, we define a named window called “status_window.” 
- This is another nice feature of PostgreSQL
- In the results, we can now see that we have the mean and standard deviation of the previous 60 rows for every entry. 
- This is similar to the calculation we did in the previous section except this time we’ll do it for every row.
- Now we can calculate the z-score for every row:

```sql
WITH calculations_over_window AS (
   SELECT
      status_code,
      period,
      entries,
      AVG(entries) OVER status_window as mean_entries,
      STDDEV(entries) OVER status_window as stddev_entries
   FROM
      server_log_summary
   WINDOW status_window AS (
      PARTITION BY status_code
      ORDER BY period
      ROWS BETWEEN 60 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   )
),

with_zscore AS (
   SELECT
       *,
       (entries - mean_entries) / NULLIF(stddev_entries::float, 0) as zscore
   FROM
       calculations_over_window
)

SELECT
   status_code,
   period,
   zscore
FROM
   with_zscore
ORDER BY
   period DESC
LIMIT
   20;
```

```

- We decided to classify values with a z-score greater than 3 as anomalies.
- You’ll often find that 3 is the magic number in textbooks, but do not get sentimental about it, because you can definitely change it to get better results

## 2 | Adding Thresholds

- In the last lesson, we detected a large number of “anomalies” with just one entry
- This is very common in errors that do not happen very often 
- In our case, every once in a while, we get a 400 status code
- However, the standard deviation is very low because it does not happen very often so even a single error can be considered way above the acceptable value
- We do not really want to receive an alert in the middle of the night just because of one 400 status code 
- We cannot have every curious developer fiddling with the dev tools in his browser wake us up in the middle of the night
- To eliminate rows with only a few entries, we set a threshold:

```sql
WITH calculations_over_window AS (
   SELECT
       status_code,
       period,
       entries,
       AVG(entries) OVER status_window as mean_entries,
       STDDEV(entries) OVER status_window as stddev_entries
   FROM
       server_log_summary
   WINDOW status_window AS (
       PARTITION BY status_code
       ORDER BY period
       ROWS BETWEEN 60 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   )
),

with_zscore AS (
   SELECT
       *,
       (entries - mean_entries) / NULLIF(stddev_entries::float, 0) as zscore
   FROM
       calculations_over_window
),

with_alert AS (

   SELECT
       *,
       entries > 10 AND zscore > 3 AS alert
   FROM
       with_zscore
)

SELECT
   status_code,
   period,
   entries,
   zscore,
   alert
FROM
   with_alert
WHERE
   alert
ORDER BY
   period DESC;

- After eliminating potential anomalies with less than 10 entries:
    - we get much fewer and probably more relevant results

## 3 | Eliminating repeated alerts

- In the previous lesson, we eliminated potential anomalies with less than 10 entries
- Using thresholds, we were able to remove some non-interesting anomalies
- Let’s have a look at the data for status code 400 after applying the threshold:
- The first alert happened at 17:59, and a minute later:
    - the z-score was still high with a large number of entries, 
    - and so we classified the next rows at 18:00 as an anomaly as well.
- If you think of an alerting system, we want to send an alert only when an anomaly first happens. 
- We do not want to send an alert every minute until the z-score comes back below the threshold. 
- In this case, we only want to send one alert at 17:59. 
- We do not want to send another alert a minute later at 18:00.
- Let’s remove alerts where the previous period was also classified as an alert:

```sql
WITH calculations_over_window AS (
   SELECT
       status_code,
       period,
       entries,
       AVG(entries) OVER status_window as mean_entries,
       STDDEV(entries) OVER status_window as stddev_entries
   FROM
       server_log_summary
   WINDOW status_window AS (
       PARTITION BY status_code
       ORDER BY period
       ROWS BETWEEN 60 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   )
),

with_zscore AS (
   SELECT
       *,
       (entries - mean_entries) / NULLIF(stddev_entries::float, 0) as zscore
   FROM
       calculations_over_window
),

with_alert AS (

   SELECT
       *,
       entries > 10 AND zscore > 3 AS alert
   FROM
       with_zscore
),

with_previous_alert AS (
   SELECT
       *,
       LAG(alert) OVER (PARTITION BY status_code ORDER BY period) AS previous_alert
   FROM
       with_alert
)

SELECT
   status_code,
   period,
   entries,
   zscore,
   alert
FROM
   with_previous_alert
WHERE
   alert AND NOT previous_alert
ORDER BY

- By eliminating alerts that were already triggered we get a very small list of anomalies that may have happened during the day 
- Looking at the results we can see what anomalies we would have discovered:
    - Anomaly in status code 400 at 17:59: We also found that one earlier  
- Anomaly in status code 404: This is a hidden anomaly that we did not know about until now
- The query can now be used to fire alerts when it encounters an anomaly
